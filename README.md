This USB-Board can be connected to Front- or Back-USB for making a configuration of NAS or (W)LAN-Router or Server.
Now passwords from chipcard can be transmitted to server for mounting hard disks or files with filesystems,
which can be encrypted by loopAES. 
If you have interests on my project please contact me.
